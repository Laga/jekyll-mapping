Using this requires an API key to be specified within _config.yml\r\n\r\n### OpenStreetMap\r\n\r\n    mapping:\r\n        provider: openstreetmap\r\n\r\nUses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) to provide interactive maps. Doesn't require an API key.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nTo use, include configuration information in _config.yml. At minimum, specify a provider:\r\n\r\n    mapping:\r\n        provider: google_static\r\n\r\nIf desired, set default dimensions for maps and a custom zoom level (the default zoom level is 10):\r\n\r\n    mapping:\r\n        provider: openstreetmap\r\n        zoom: 8\r\n        dimensions:\r\n            width: 600\r\n            height: 400\r\n\r\nIf using Google JS API, include an API key:\r\n\r\n    mapping:\r\n        provider: google_js\r\n        api_key: 123456\r\n        zoom: 10\r\n        dimensions:\r\n            width: 600\r\n            height: 400\r\n\r\nPut the contents of '_includes' in your '_includes' directory and the contents of '_plugins' in your '_plugins' directory (or just copy the directories if you don't have those directories yet).\r\n\r\nSet the relevant values in the YAML front matter of pages and posts:\r\n\r\n    mapping:\r\n        latitude: 51.101\r\n        longitude: 0.1\r\n\r\nInclude the render_map tag in your templates where you'd like the map to appear:\r\n\r\n    {% render_map %}\r\n\r\nOptionally, specify the width for the map here:\r\n    \r\n    {% render_map 500,500 %}\r\n\r\nInclude the required JavaScript at the foot of your templates:\r\n\r\n    {% include jekyll_mapping.html %}\r\n    </body>\r\n\r\nYou don't need to wrap the above in any if statements - jekyll-mapping won't output anything if the page doesn't have both a latitude and longitude set.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n## Further usage\r\n\r\nAt it's most basic, you can just set a latitude and longitude for a piece of content. In this case, it'll just plot that location on a map. However, you can do some other exciting things too!\r\n\r\nIf you set multiple locations, they'll all be mapped and the map will be zoomed and panned to fit them. Do it like so:\r\n\r\n    mapping:\r\n        locations:\r\n            - title: foo\r\n              latitude: 10\r\n              longitude: 10\r\n            - title: bar\r\n              latitude: -10\r\n              longitude: -10\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use KML, you can do that too. Just add 'layers' in a similar fashion:\r\n\r\n    mapping:\r\n        layers:\r\n            - http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?g=322338@N20&lang=en-us&format=feed-georss\r\n            - http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ggeoxml/cta.kml\r\n\r\nRight now, multiple locations works for both google_js and openstreetmap. KML definitely works for google_js and should work for openstreetmap, but needs more testing.\r\n","google":""}
